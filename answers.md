### Question 1
1. **Database Engine**: Core service that handles data storage, retrieval, and manipulation.
2. **Database Schema**: Defines the structure and organization of the database, including tables and relationships.
3. **Query Processor**: Parses and executes database queries.
4. **Transaction Manager**: Ensures data integrity during multiple operations by supporting transactions.
5. **Data Dictionary**: Metadata repository that stores information about database schema and objects.
6. **Reporting and Analytics Tools**: Allow users to generate reports and analyze data.

### Question 2
A relational database is a type of database that organizes data into structured tables with rows and columns. Data is accessed using SQL based on relationships between tables.

**Examples**:
1. MySQL
2. PostgreSQL
3. Oracle Database
4. Microsoft SQL Server

---

### Question 3
1. **Data Definition Language (DDL)**:
   - Used to define or modify the structure of the database.
   - Examples: `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`.

2. **Data Manipulation Language (DML)**:
   - Used to retrieve, insert, update, or delete data.
   - Examples: `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.

3. **Data Control Language (DCL)**:
   - Used to control access and permissions.
   - Examples: `GRANT`, `REVOKE`.

---

### Question 4
- **Primary Key**: A unique identifier for each record in a table. Ensures no duplicates.
- **Foreign Key**: A field in one table that establishes a link to the Primary Key in another table, ensuring referential integrity.

---

### Question 5
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of the database structure. It shows entities (tables), attributes (fields), and the relationships between them.

---

### Question 6
1. **Data Integrity**: Maintains accuracy and consistency.
2. **Flexibility**: Allows complex queries with SQL.
3. **Data Security**: Provides access control and permissions.
4. **Scalability**: Easily supports growing datasets.

---

### Question 7
1. **Integer**: Stores whole numbers (e.g., `INT`).
2. **Character/String**: Stores text (e.g., `CHAR`, `VARCHAR`).
3. **Date/Time**: Stores dates and timestamps (e.g., `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`).
4. **Boolean**: Stores `TRUE` or `FALSE` values.

---

### Question 8
A DBMS allows users to efficiently store, manage, retrieve, and secure data. It provides an interface between users and the database, ensuring data consistency, integrity, and security.
